            <h3>Web Frontend Development 2 - Class Project</h3>
            <p>
              This was our primary group project for the semester. We developed
              a functional online shopping platform that dynamically retrieves
              all its data from an API. The project served as an opportunity to
              learn and build with Svelte, which we used to create and structure
              the code.

            <h3>Web Frontend Development 2 - Final Project</h3>
            <p>
              This was our final group project for the semester. Although we
              didn't fully complete it, we successfully implemented a functional
              backend capable of storing and retrieving user data for login and
              account management. The project utilized an API to incorporate
              Pok√©mon data and was built as a single-page application using
              Svelte as the primary framework.
